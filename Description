Splunk REST API Interaction using Python

Project Description:

The objective of this project is to develop a Python script that interacts with Splunk's REST API to retrieve and analyze data. The script will allow users to query and analyze data stored in Splunk using Python code. This project will help to automate data analysis tasks, allowing users to extract insights and make informed decisions.

Key Features:

The Python script will use the Splunk REST API to retrieve data from Splunk
The script will allow users to query the data and extract relevant information
The script will provide a user-friendly interface for data analysis and visualization
The project will use Python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib for data analysis and visualization
The project will include documentation on how to use the script and interact with the Splunk REST API
Steps:

Install the required Python libraries (such as requests, pandas, and matplotlib)
Authenticate with Splunk using the Splunk REST API
Query the data using the Splunk REST API and retrieve the relevant information
Store the data in a pandas dataframe for further analysis and visualization
Analyze the data using pandas and matplotlib
Visualize the data using matplotlib
Provide a user-friendly interface for data analysis and visualization
Write documentation on how to use the script and interact with the Splunk REST API.
Expected Outcome:
A Python script that interacts with Splunk's REST API to retrieve and analyze data, providing users with a user-friendly interface for data analysis and visualization. This project will allow users to automate data analysis tasks and extract insights from data stored in Splunk. Additionally, this project will help users develop skills in Python programming, data analysis, and visualization, as well as in using Splunk's REST API.
